This is a project to bootstrap an MVP with the most important libraries that have worked for me in the past. It saves at least three man days of work in setting up:
* a fully functional web application with good look and feel (Tailwind),
* no hassle front and back-end with Phero and TypeScript,
* an authentication and backend store with Firebase
